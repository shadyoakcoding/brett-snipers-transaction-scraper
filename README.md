# brett-snipers-transaction-scraper
This repository was made in order to get all of the $BRETT transactions that whitelisted wallets did in order to import them into metasleuth.
Both index.js and transactionBundler.js are both completely written by ChatGPT, I did send some followup prompts in order to make it do more precisely what I was asking.
Sniper List.csv are the addresses that I got from the data in the transaction where $BRETT was deployed.
